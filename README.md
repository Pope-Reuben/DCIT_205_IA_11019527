### Well hello there!

## Introduction and the purpose of the website.
The website has a homepage and seven other pages. The website created is to introduce foreigners and other people of the type of euducation offered by the department, and the resources that the deparment has, that is the quality of teachers and so on. The website shows some entry requirements, pictures of the university, and the courses that we offer.for example, our Mphil and Msc programmes, undergraduate courses and Phd courses. webpages have been assigned to elaborate about each courses being offered. there is also a webpage that has been designed to talk about us , especially we at the department.

## Detailed instructions on how to clone and set up the project.
Using the current official website of the Department as a lookup, I will be be building a similar website but there will be a big difference between the cloned websit and the official website.

 What I have learned from the project.
 there some html tags that I have never come across before but this project has forced me to study these tags. this project has opened my eyes and has helped me to look at a website in a different way.
